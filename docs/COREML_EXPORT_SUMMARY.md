# CoreML Export Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented CoreML export for Kokoro TTS model with a two-stage approach to handle dynamic shapes.

## Key Files Changed

### 1. `examples/export_coreml.py`
- Main export script implementing the bucketing strategy
- Created CoreML-friendly versions of TextEncoder and DurationEncoder that avoid pack_padded_sequence
- Exports Duration Model (dynamic input) and multiple Synthesizer Models (fixed-size buckets)

### 2. `kokoro/istftnet.py` 
- Modified line 380: Changed `torch.tensor(2)` to `torch.tensor(2.0)` to fix dtype issue
- Ensures float type for rsqrt operation in CoreML

### 3. `test_duration_model.py` (new)
- Test script to validate exported Duration Model
- Verifies CoreML output matches PyTorch

### 4. `export_synthesizers_only.py` (new)
- Standalone script to export only synthesizer models
- Useful for iterating on synthesizer export without re-exporting duration model

## Exported Models

### âœ… Duration Model: `coreml/kokoro_duration.mlpackage` (54MB)
- Takes variable-length text input (1-512 tokens)
- Outputs predicted durations and intermediate features
- Successfully exported and tested

### ðŸš§ Synthesizer Models (planned):
- `kokoro_synthesizer_3s.mlpackage` - For audio up to 3 seconds
- `kokoro_synthesizer_5s.mlpackage` - For audio up to 5 seconds  
- `kokoro_synthesizer_10s.mlpackage` - For audio up to 10 seconds
- `kokoro_synthesizer_30s.mlpackage` - For audio up to 30 seconds

## Implementation Strategy

The bucketing approach solves CoreML's dynamic shape limitations:
1. Duration Model predicts audio length with dynamic text input
2. Swift client selects appropriate fixed-size Synthesizer based on predicted duration
3. Alignment matrix is padded to match the selected bucket size
4. Output audio is trimmed to remove padding

## Commit Message

```
feat: Add CoreML export for Kokoro TTS model

- Implement two-stage export strategy with Duration and Synthesizer models
- Create CoreML-friendly model wrappers avoiding pack_padded_sequence
- Export Duration Model supporting dynamic input lengths (1-512 tokens)
- Add bucketing strategy for Synthesizer models (3s, 5s, 10s, 30s)
- Fix dtype issues in istftnet.py for CoreML compatibility
- Add test script to validate Duration Model export

The Duration Model (54MB) successfully exports and handles the complex
linguistic processing. Synthesizer models use fixed-size buckets to
work around CoreML's dynamic shape limitations while maximizing ANE
performance.
